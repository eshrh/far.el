* far.el: minimal variance paragraph filling

Far.el is a reimplementation of [[https://stephen-huan.github.io/blog/far/][far]] by [[https://github.com/stephen-huan][stephen huan]].

It is an alternative to =fill-paragraph=, which reflows the paragraph
greedily. Far chooses line lengths by minimizing the variance of lines
subject to a width constraint.

* Dependencies

There are currently two non built in dependencies but these might go
away in the future if I decide to rewrite some bits more verbosely

+ =s.el=: string utils
+ =dash.el=: list utils

There is a good chance you already have one or two of these
packages installed if you use some common packages like magit.

=cl-lib= is also depended upon, which has been included in emacs since
24.3

* Installation

You could copy =far.el= into your load path the manual way, or you
could use a package manager like straight:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(far :type git
       :repo "https://github.com/eshrh/far.el"))
#+END_SRC
